# Minicoding-Projects
This Repository Contains my coding projects from coursework from CHM676: Molecular Spectroscopy. We had to create a molecular dynamics simulation for a technique covered in class. I calculated 2D-IR spectrum for Î²-sheets by using morse oscillators to simulathe the carbonyl stretches.
